# Data-Science-Tools

This course teaches about the day-to-day experiences of Data Scientists. You’ll be introduced to some of the programming languages commonly used, including Python, R, Scala, and SQL. You’ll work with the tools that professional Data Scientists work with, like Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio IDE, and others. You will learn about what each tool is used for, what languages they can execute, and their features and limitations. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Cognitive Class Labs, you will be able to use each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R, or Scala.

In this course, you will:
        Explore the languages, tools, and data that data scientists use.
        Use common open source tools to  perform data science tasks.
        Discover IBM tools focused on data science.
